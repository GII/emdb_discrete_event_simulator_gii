# e-MDB discrete event simulator to be used in simple experiments

This repository contains the packages that implements a discrete event simulator of the Baxter robot. This simulator has no physics simulation at all. It is just a simulator that assumes a perfect world where nothing fails that it is used to test concepts / algorithms in the cognitive architecture.

There are two ROS 2 packages in this repository:

- **simulators:** Implementation of discrete event simulator.
- **simulators_interfaces:** Services and messages definitions.

You can find information and tutorials about this repository and the others that are part of the e-MDB cognitive architecture software in the [PILLAR Robots official documentation](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/en/latest/)
